To keep it simple

- Limit movement to only x axis
    - left, right, pitch
- 1 motor for left and right
- 1 motor for pitch
- custom gear design allows for smooth rotations and actions


How will I achieve the movement?
- drive train?
    - drive train will make it easier for the addition of y axis movement
    - will severly limit pitch angle
- rail system?
    - will have no pitch 
    - same design can be implemented to achieve y and z axis movement

Movement achieved by
- Drive train
    - there will be 4 wheels. Motors will be required to control the rotation of the wheels and also the 
        forward and backward movement of the wheel as well
            - omnidirectional wheels.. how do they work?
    - pitch
        - pitch will have to be achieved by rotating the robot arm around a hinge that allows 
        180 degrees of movement around the x axis
            - this will probably be at the base of the robot


Things to design
- Custom left, right movement system
- custom angular rotation system



Things to buy
- Motor
    - how to I control the motor?
        - Arduino. will I use arduino IDE to code this?
- Remote controller
    - how do I get the remote controller to send signals such that it can activate the motor?

Code backbone for this
- Power on
    - 
- left, right, pitch
    - 


Key questions
- Can the same movement systems for x axis movement be implemented for y axis movement?
    - What are some developments that can be made?
