Robotic Arm Component Research


Degrees of freedom
- 6 degrees of freedom
    - x axis: left, right, pitch
    - y axis: front, back, roll
    - z axis: up, down, yaw
- 6 motors for each degree of freedom
    - 1 for left and right
    - 1 for pitch
    - 1 for front and back
    - 1 for roll
    - 1 for up and down
    - 1 for yaw



EOAT Ideas
- For tapping mechanism
    - just a small end with a textture that can be read by screens or pressure sensors
- For gripping mechanism
    - custom gripping mechanism
        - will need more actuators for this
- 3 claw EOAT that can rotate
    - Can all 3 claws be moved in the same manner with 1 actuator?
        - CW rotation making claw close
        - CCW roation make claw open
